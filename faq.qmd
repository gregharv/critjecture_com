## General Questions

::: {.faq-section}
**Q: How much do AI and ontological systems cost?**  
A: Pricing typically ranges from $5,000-$50,000. The final cost depends heavily on how scattered your data sources are - more dispersed data requires more complex ontological mapping and integration work. Simple projects with 2-3 data sources might cost $5,000-$15,000, while complex systems integrating 10+ scattered data sources can reach $30,000-$50,000. I offer a free consultation to assess your specific data landscape and provide a detailed quote.

**Q: How long does it take to build an AI and ontological system?**  
A: Project duration correlates with data complexity: simple projects (2-3 data sources) typically take few weeks, while complex systems (10+ scattered data sources) can take 5-10 weeks. The timeline depends on how dispersed your data sources are and the level of ontological mapping required. I'll provide a detailed timeline after our initial consultation.

**Q: What if I'm not sure AI and ontological systems are right for my business?**  
A: That's exactly why I offer free consultations. I'll help you understand if and how AI and ontological systems could benefit your specific situation.

**Q: Do you provide ongoing support?**  
A: Yes, I offer ongoing support and optimization services to ensure your AI solutions continue to deliver value.

**Q: What about security and compliance?**  
A: Security is built into every solution from the ground up. I have deep experience with regulated industries and can ensure compliance with your specific requirements.

## Data Science Services After Ontology Setup

::: {.faq-section}
**Q: What data science services are available after ontology setup?**  
A: Once your business data is organized into a robust ontology, a world of advanced analytics and AI capabilities becomes possible. Here are the key services we can build on top of your knowledge foundation:

**Q: Which of my current customers are most likely to leave in the next month?**  
A: <abbr title="We identify the key warning signs in your data (like decreased usage or specific support issues) to create a priority list of at-risk customers, so your team can proactively intervene and save them.">The Customer Churn Predictor</abbr>

**Q: Which of my new customers will become my most valuable ones over time?**  
A: <abbr title="We predict the long-term value of new customers right when they sign up. This helps you focus your best resources on high-potential clients and understand how much you can afford to spend to acquire them.">The Lifetime Value (LTV) Forecaster</abbr>

**Q: What should this specific customer buy next?**  
A: <abbr title="By analyzing past purchase patterns, we build a 'recommendation engine' to suggest the right next product or service upgrade for each individual customer, increasing your average order value.">The Up-sell & Cross-sell Recommender</abbr>

**Q: Which new leads should my sales team focus on today?**  
A: <abbr title="We automatically score every new lead based on their likelihood to buy. This allows your sales team to stop guessing and spend their valuable time on the prospects most likely to close.">The Lead Scoring Prioritizer</abbr>

**Q: Which of my marketing channels are actually driving sales?**  
A: <abbr title="We figure out which ads, emails, and social media posts are truly contributing to sales, not just getting the last click. This lets you confidently re-invest your marketing budget in what works and cut what doesn't.">The Marketing Attribution Modeler</abbr>
