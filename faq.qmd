## Understanding the Basics

::: {.faq-section}
**Q: What is a semantic layer, and why do I need one?**  
A: It’s a shared, business friendly map of your company’s information spanning your apps (CRM, accounting, e‑commerce), databases, and knowledge (policies, procedures, intranet). It defines common terms like “customer,” “order,” and “refund,” and shows how they relate. With one consistent layer, you get reliable, explainable answers across your systems and documents.

**Q: Do you build the semantic layer first, then AI?**  
A: Yes. The semantic layer is the foundation. Once that’s in place, we enable AI Q&A and analytics that link every answer back to source data and documents. From there, we can add advanced decision models that help you test business ideas with evidence.

## General Questions

::: {.faq-section}
**Q: How much does a semantic layer and AI Q&A system cost?**  
A: Typically $5,000–$50,000, depending on scope and integrations. A starter (a few sources, focused outcomes) is often $5,000–$15,000. Larger, multisystem rollups and document ingestion typically range $30,000–$50,000. You’ll get a fixed, detailed quote after a free consultation.

**Q: How long does it take?**  
A: From a few weeks to several months, based on complexity and the number of systems/documents. You’ll get a clear plan with milestones after discovery.

**Q: What if I’m not sure this is right for my business?**  
A: That’s why the initial consultation is free. We’ll discuss your goals and I’ll give an honest assessment, no pressure.

**Q: Who will I be working with?**  
A: Me. As a solo consultant, I’m your strategist, builder, and single point of contact.

**Q: Do you provide ongoing support?**  
A: Yes, optional retainers for maintenance, evolution, and new integrations.

**Q: What about data security and privacy?**  
A: Security is baked in from day one. I have experience in the utility industry and military with many data governance requirements. I adapt to your compliance and data governance requirements.

## Technical & Process Questions

::: {.faq-section}
**Q: What makes your AI solutions different?**  
A: Transparency. Because answers come through the semantic layer, every result links to its sources (tables, documents, and definitions). Your team can see why an answer is what it is.

**Q: Do you work with our existing systems and documents?**  
A: Yes. We integrate your apps (APIs, databases) and ingest unstructured knowledge (PDFs, SOPs, intranet) into one searchable, traceable layer.

**Q: How do you ensure the solution meets our needs?**  
A: Iterative cycles of conjecture and criticism, regular demos, feedback, and adjustments to keep the layer aligned with real use.

## What’s Next? Advanced Decision Modeling

::: {.faq-section}
Once your information is unified in the semantic layer, we move from reporting to testing business ideas. Instead of a “crystal ball,” we build tools to challenge strategies, surface counterexamples, and model decisions with evidence.
