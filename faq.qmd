## General Questions

::: {.faq-section}
**Q: How much do AI and ontological systems cost?**  
A: Pricing typically ranges from $5,000-$50,000. The final cost depends heavily on how scattered your data sources are - more dispersed data requires more complex ontological mapping and integration work. Simple projects with 2-3 data sources might cost $5,000-$15,000, while complex systems integrating 10+ scattered data sources can reach $30,000-$50,000. I offer a free consultation to assess your specific data landscape and provide a detailed quote.

**Q: How long does it take to build an AI and ontological system?**  
A: Project duration correlates with data complexity: simple projects (2-3 data sources) typically take 4-6 weeks, while complex systems (10+ scattered data sources) can take 8-16 weeks. The timeline depends on how dispersed your data sources are and the level of ontological mapping required. I'll provide a detailed timeline during our initial consultation.

**Q: What if I'm not sure AI and ontological systems are right for my business?**  
A: That's exactly why I offer free consultations. I'll help you understand if and how AI and ontological systems could benefit your specific situation.

**Q: Do you provide ongoing support?**  
A: Yes, I offer ongoing support and optimization services to ensure your AI solutions continue to deliver value.

**Q: What about security and compliance?**  
A: Security is built into every solution from the ground up. I have deep experience with regulated industries and can ensure compliance with your specific requirements.
