**Businesses possess vast amounts of data, but is it creating knowledge? Knowledge is forged through <abbr title="The philosophical approach that knowledge advances by proposing creative hypotheses (conjectures) and then attempting to refute them (criticism).">criticism and conjecture</abbr>. We transform scattered information across apps, databases, PDFs, and internal sites into a unified <strong>semantic layer</strong> (a shared map of your business) that empowers people and AI to ask clear questions, get verifiable answers, and rigorously test ideas — especially for mid‑sized e‑commerce and subscription brands that need clarity across sales, marketing, finance, and operations.**

## Who We Serve

- **Mid‑sized e‑commerce and subscription brands (roughly $2M–$100M ARR/GMV)**
- **Lean teams** that need leverage more than headcount
- **Scattered systems** (Shopify/Stripe/Klaviyo/HubSpot/QuickBooks) and document sprawl (SOPs, intranet)
- **Outcome focus**: faster reporting, traceable answers, and tested decisions

### Semantic Layer Engineering
We design and implement a unified semantic layer that connects your core systems (CRM, accounting, marketing, e‑commerce, etc.) and operational knowledge (policies, procedures, manuals, intranet). This becomes your centralized record of knowledge for analysis and decision making.

### Transparent AI & Analytics
AI doesn’t create knowledge, but it’s a powerful tool for criticism. Using your semantic layer, we build traceable analytics and AI assistants where every answer links back to sources (data tables, documents, and definitions). Your team can interrogate results instead of blindly trusting them.

## Quick Win Diagnostic (2 Weeks, $500)
Money‑back guarantee if you don’t find at least one actionable improvement.

Deliverables:

- Visual map of data and knowledge flows across your stack
- Quantified inefficiencies and handoffs slowing decisions
- Baseline KPIs and a prioritized backlog of 3–5 quick wins
- ROI hypothesis and implementation plan for the top quick win

## Our Approach: Modular Phases

**Phase 1 — Build the Semantic Layer (Unified Knowledge)**  
  Connect structured data and unstructured knowledge into a single, shared context. Enable verifiable answers with linked sources.

**Phase 2 — Test Your Business (The Critjecture Engine)**  
  Move from reporting to refutation. We help you challenge your own strategies with evidence, profiling risky segments, running decision impact scenarios, and surfacing counterexamples so weak ideas fail fast and strong ideas scale.

- **Start Anywhere**: Already have a warehouse or BI? We plug into what’s working. Want AI first? We’ll scope a safe, source‑traceable pilot.

- **Modular Pricing**: Phases are independently purchasable with bundled discounts for full adoption.

## Our Working Cycle

::: {.approach-grid}
::: {.approach-item}
### 1. Discovery & Conjecture
We explore your data landscape and propose initial business definitions and relationships in the semantic layer.
:::

::: {.approach-item}
### 2. Modeling & Criticism
We implement the layer and rigorously challenge it, validating logic against real scenarios and refining until it fits reality.
:::

::: {.approach-item}
### 3. Activation & Integration
We make the semantic layer the backbone for analytics and AI. Ask questions across data and documents with traceable sources.
:::

::: {.approach-item}
### 4. Evolution & Refinement
Knowledge isn’t static. We establish a change process so the layer evolves with your business and stays useful.

## Operational AI Retainer Tied to KPIs

Stay effective after launch. The retainer focuses on measurable outcomes, not “AI babysitting.”

- **Report turnaround time**: reduce by X% each quarter
- **Time‑to‑insight** for decision questions: downtrend with target thresholds
- **Self‑serve Q&A adoption**: track usage and satisfaction
- **SLA for model and content updates**: prioritized backlog with response times
- **Quarterly strategy workshop**: review outcomes, surface counterexamples, plan next experiments
:::

::: {.section}
## Why We’re Different

- **E‑commerce semantic templates**: accelerate time‑to‑value with domain models for orders, subscriptions, cohorts, returns, CAC/LTV, and attribution
- **Transparency by default**: every number and answer links to sources and definitions
- **Change enablement**: workflows, training, and governance so models stick
- **Start fast, prove value**: 2‑week diagnostic with a money‑back guarantee

## See Our Philosophy in Action

Curious what a transparent AI workflow looks like? Our demo shows traceable answers, interactive charts, and linked sources.

This is the future of data interaction: not a black box, but a clear, auditable process.
