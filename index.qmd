**Businesses possess vast amounts of data, but is it creating knowledge? Knowledge is forged through <abbr title="The philosophical approach that knowledge advances by proposing creative hypotheses (conjectures) and then attempting to refute them (criticism).">criticism and conjecture</abbr>. We transform scattered information across apps, databases, PDFs, and internal sites into a unified <strong>semantic layer</strong> (a shared map of your business) that empowers people and AI to ask clear questions, get verifiable answers, and rigorously test ideas.**

### Semantic Layer Engineering
We design and implement a unified semantic layer that connects your core systems (CRM, accounting, marketing, e‑commerce, etc.) and operational knowledge (policies, procedures, manuals, intranet). This becomes your centalized record of knowledge for analysis and decision making.

### Transparent AI & Analytics
AI doesn’t create knowledge, but it’s a powerful tool for criticism. Using your semantic layer, we build traceable analytics and AI assistants where every answer links back to sources (data tables, documents, and definitions). Your team can interrogate results instead of blindly trusting them.

## Why Critjecture?

Standard data efforts are passive. Ours is an active dialogue. Through rapid cycles of conjecture (proposing models) and criticism (testing them against reality), we forge a living semantic layer, not just a pile of dashboards.

As a solo consultant, you get a dedicated partner focused on building a robust, testable foundation that’s uniquely yours.

## Our Approach: Two Steps

- **Step 1 — Build the Semantic Layer (Unified Knowledge)**  
  Connect structured data and unstructured knowledge into a single, shared context. Enable verifiable answers with linked sources.

- **Step 2 — Test Your Business (The Critjecture Engine)**  
  Move from reporting to refutation. We help you challenge your own strategies with evidence, profiling risky segments, running decision impact scenarios, and surfacing counterexamples so weak ideas fail fast and strong ideas scale.

## Our Working Cycle

::: {.approach-grid}
::: {.approach-item}
### 1. Discovery & Conjecture
We explore your data landscape and propose initial business definitions and relationships in the semantic layer.
:::

::: {.approach-item}
### 2. Modeling & Criticism
We implement the layer and rigorously challenge it, validating logic against real scenarios and refining until it fits reality.
:::

::: {.approach-item}
### 3. Activation & Integration
We make the semantic layer the backbone for analytics and AI. Ask questions across data and documents with traceable sources.
:::

::: {.approach-item}
### 4. Evolution & Refinement
Knowledge isn’t static. We establish a change process so the layer evolves with your business and stays useful.

Curious what a transparent AI workflow looks like? Our demo shows traceable answers, interactive charts, and linked sources.

This is the future of data interaction: not a black box, but a clear, auditable process.
